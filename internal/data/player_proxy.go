// and the precise name of tables from the exterior world.

// The `dbase` is the database that is wrapped by this
// object. It is checked for consistency upon building the
// wrapper.
//
// The `log` allows to perform display to the user so as
// to inform of potential issues and debug information to
// the outside world.
